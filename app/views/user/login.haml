        Although I have made every effort to ensure Schedulr is compatible with Novasis, I cannot guarantee this.  Any schedule is not valid until it has been submitted and accepted on Novasis.  Villanova University is not responsible for or affiliated with Schedulr.  Use Schedulr at your own risk.
